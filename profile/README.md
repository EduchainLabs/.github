## Overview

EduChain Labs is a comprehensive Web3 learning platform built for the EduChain ecosystem. It combines interactive blockchain education with hands-on Solidity practice, AI-powered support, and real-world challenge rewards. Our platform bridges the gap between theoretical blockchain knowledge and practical development skills.

![Platform Overview](https://github.com/EduchainLabs/Showcase/blob/main/EarlyAccess.png)

EduChain Labs empowers learners to:
- Practice Solidity through a LeetCode-style code arena with real-time validation
- Complete blockchain courses and earn verifiable NFT certificates
- Participate in company-posted challenges and earn on-chain bounties
- Interact with an AI chatbot for 24/7 learning assistance
- Log in securely using OpenCampus ID (OCID)

## Key Features

### üîπ Solidity Practice Arena
A LeetCode-style coding platform where users can get a experience suitable AI Generated Problem Statement for Smart Contract Development They can write, compile, and test Solidity smart contracts. Includes AI-driven feedback and real-time code validation to help reinforce learning.

### üîπ NFT-Certified Courses
Earn verifiable NFT certificates upon course completion. Each course include theoritical knowledge & some of the courses also include Hands On Challenges where users can practice what they learn at the instant. Each certificate is minted via IPFS using Pinata and tied to the user's wallet‚Äîmaking achievements permanent and tamper-proof.
